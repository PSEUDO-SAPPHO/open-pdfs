EZs are also capable of contributing to export development, not only in terms of accelerating export growth, but export diversification as well. This is particularly important to poorer developing countries reliant on the export of primary products. In addition, zones can play an important role in attracting foreign direct investment, offsetting some aspects of an adverse investment climate by offering worldclass facilities and best practice policies. The scope for increased development of supply and other linkages through the use of free zones appears to be significant, due to a greater incentive for local firms to sell goods and services to zonebased enterprises because such sales are typically “deemed” exports, eligible for duty drawback and other export incentives.”
